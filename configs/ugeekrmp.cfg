# Sample configuration file for retrogame.
# Really minimal syntax, typically two elements per line w/space delimiter:
# 1) a key name (from keyTable.h; shortened from /usr/include/linux/input.h).
# 2) a GPIO pin number; when grounded, will simulate corresponding keypress.
# Uses Broadcom pin numbers for GPIO.
# If first element is GND, the corresponding pin (or pins, multiple can be
# given) is a LOW-level output; an extra ground pin for connecting buttons.
# A '#' character indicates a comment to end-of-line.
# File can be edited "live," no need to restart retrogame!

# Here's a pin configuration for the Adafruit Arcade Bonnet.  This board is
# based on the MCP23017 I2C port expander, with a default address of 0x26
# (solder jumper selects 0x27 if needed).  retrogame treats port expanders
# as their own GPIO pin numbers beyond the normal 0-31:

#    0 -  31   GPIO header 'P5' (Broadcom pin numbers)
#   32 -  47   MCP23017 at address 0x20
#   48 -  63   MCP23017 at address 0x21
#   64 -  79   MCP23017 at address 0x22
#   80 -  95   MCP23017 at address 0x23
#   96 - 111   MCP23017 at address 0x24
#  112 - 127   MCP23017 at address 0x25
#  128 - 143   MCP23017 at address 0x26 *** Arcade Bonnet default address
#  144 - 159   MCP23017 at address 0x27 *** Arcade Bonnet alt address

# The Arcade Bonnet MUST be enabled with the IRQ command to
# assign an interrupt request GPIO pin and I2C bus address.
# IRQ pin for this board is hardwired as 17.

IRQ 26 0x20  # Arcade Bonnet default address, use GPIO 128-143
